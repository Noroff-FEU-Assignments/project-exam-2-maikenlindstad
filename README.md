# Noroff Community Social Media

Welcome to NO.CO!

NO.CO is a social media app for the students and teachers of Noroff. Joining NO.CO can help you build gaps between graphic designers, front- and back end developers, 3D designers, photographers and more.

## Guided usertest

During the user test it can be helpful to keep a notepad next to you whenever questions are raised.
The notes can be sent to some email.

To user test this project please do the following:

- Start by entering: [NO.CO Noroff Community](https://no-co.netlify.app/)
- Log in or sign up
- You have now entered the social media app. Take a few moments to browse the site.
- Personalize your account by adding your own banner and avatar.
  (A known issue is that the banner and avatar do not immediately update.
  Try logging in and out to see your changes.)
- Write your first post. Do the example first. Then, if you'd like, write something of your own.
  Example:
  Title: Hello!
  Content: What a lovely day.
  Image url: Keep empty
- View your post, edit it by adding the following:
  Content: What a lovely day to share something.
- Update your post.
- Now, delete your post and rather write your own post if you'd like.
- Find a user you find interesting, and follow the user.
  (A known issue is that the style of the follow button is not toggling properly. You can confirm that you are following the person by clicking the follow button again and if the page do not reload, then you are following that person.)
- If you want, you can unfollow the person, or follow more people. Its totally up to you.
- Write more posts, or visit your own profile and look at your own profile page.
- Find your way to the latest posts again and find a post you like.
- Comment and like that post, if you want.
- Log out

Thank you for participating! <3

## Cloning the project and working on it locally

### Installing

Clone the repo.

Install dependencies.
`npm install`

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
